### Welcome to The Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand's GitHub Organisation


We are a collection of IT volunteers working for a just world through political action. That involves coding for our internal and public-facing systems, as well as more general tech development, discussion and maintenance. Our efforts are co-ordinated by the Green Party staff, the GreenTech Committee and wider whānau, where we cultivate an environment of supporting volunteers to achieve meaningful change in line with [Green Party values](https://www.greens.org.nz/charter).

Some of our projects are public but a lot goes on in private. If you'd like to support our work please contact us via [greenparty@greens.org.nz](mailto:greenparty@greens.org.nz).
